Listed at [skills.sh/woosal1337/blog/asd-ste100](https://www.skills.sh/woosal1337/blog/asd-ste100).

An agent skill that removes AI slop with a writing system, not a banned-word
list. Layer 1 rewrites the words into ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English,
the controlled language built in the 1980s so an aircraft mechanic could never
misread a repair manual. Layer 2 shapes the reply for a reader with ADHD: the
next action first, numbered steps, real time estimates, no preamble and no
closer.

The claim behind it was tested: six engineering writing tasks, four
conditions, two model families, scored as violations per 100 words.

| Condition | Claude sonnet | gpt-5.5 |
|---|---|---|
| baseline | 4.36 | 3.54 |
| banned-words list | 4.21 (-3%) | 2.14 (-40%) |
| Orwell's six rules | 2.48 (-43%) | 1.69 (-52%) |
| **this skill** | **1.12 (-74%)** | **1.76 (-50%)** |

## Install

Pick one route. Do not stack them - two routes double the hooks.

**Claude Code, as a plugin.** This folder is a standard plugin: the skill at
the root, the hooks declared in `hooks/hooks.json`. They self-register on
install, no settings edit:

```
/plugin marketplace add woosal1337/blog
/plugin install asd-ste100@chele-bi
```

**Any agent the [skills CLI](https://skills.sh) supports.** This installs the
skill files. On Claude Code, `install.py` then arms the hooks and the output
style through settings:

```
bunx skills add woosal1337/blog
python3 ~/.claude/skills/asd-ste100/install.py
```

The registry page for that command is the listing above. It reads this repo
directly, so the page and the folder never drift apart.

**No tooling at all.** Paste `SKILL.md` into the system prompt. The skill
works without the linter. The linter closes the loop.

## Layout

The folder follows the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io) and the
Claude Code plugin format at the same time:

```
SKILL.md                     the skill - name, description, the two layers
scripts/ste-lint.py          executable code, per the spec convention
references/ste-recurring-errors.md   docs loaded on demand
hooks/hooks.json             the plugin's hook declarations
hooks/ste-*.py               the four hook programs
.claude-plugin/plugin.json   the plugin manifest
install.py, output-style.md  the settings route, for non-plugin installs
```

## What the enforcement stack adds

A skill is advisory. The model can forget it on a long turn. `install.py`
therefore arms every deterministic layer Claude Code offers. It symlinks the
skill and the output style, adds four hook entries to
`~/.claude/settings.json`, and backs the old file up first. A second run
repairs the install. `--uninstall` removes exactly what it added.

| Layer | File | When it fires | What it guarantees |
|---|---|---|---|
| style | `output-style.md` | every request | the rule sits in the system prompt |
| card | `hooks/ste-inject.py` | every user turn | the rule enters context, with the last score |
| refresh | `hooks/ste-refresh.py` | every 12 tool calls | the rule stays near the reply on a long turn |
| pre-send | `hooks/ste-pregate.py` | before a commit runs | a sloppy commit message never lands |
| file check | `hooks/ste-refresh.py` | after a Write of an md file | a written doc gets its score in the same turn |
| gate | `hooks/ste-gate.py` | when the reply ends | every finished reply is linted |

The gate keeps three bands. A clean reply passes in silence. A reply over the
target gets its score shown on the next turn. Only a reply over a hard
ceiling forces one rewrite, one time per turn.

## The linter

```
python3 scripts/ste-lint.py draft.md            # flavored: general prose, target under 2.5
python3 scripts/ste-lint.py --strict draft.md   # strict: procedures and error messages
python3 scripts/ste-lint.py --shape draft.md    # add the Layer 2 reply-shape counts
```

The score is violations per 100 words. `--json` gives machine-readable
output. `--fail-over N` exits 1 over the threshold, for CI gates and hooks.
Python 3 standard library only, no dependencies.

## Scope

Layer 1 governs every word a human reads: docs, commit messages, PR text,
comments, error messages. Layer 2 governs a reply to a person. Neither layer
touches code, identifiers, or command syntax. Writing that needs a voice — a
blog post, an essay, marketing copy — is out of scope on purpose. STE is
deliberately flat.

The hooks and the installer are Claude Code only. The skill file itself works
with every agent the skills CLI supports.

## Provenance

Built for the episode "The cure for AI slop is a 1986 aircraft manual". This
folder lives in the blog repo at `videos/ep01-the-cure-for-ai-slop/asd-ste100/`
and is the canonical source. The skills CLI installs it straight from there —
no mirror, no second repo.
