"""PreToolUse hook for the asd-ste100 skill. The pre-send gate.

The Stop gate has a structural cost: it runs after the reply is on the
reader's screen, so a block puts a second copy there. This gate has no such
cost. It runs BEFORE the tool call, so a deny reaches the model only. The
model corrects the text and makes the same call again, and the reader sees
one clean result. This makes commit messages and board text deterministic in
a way the reply itself can never be.

Gated text:

- Bash        the commit message, from -m arguments and the heredoc body
- Elliptic    title, description, and body fields on create and update calls

Everything fails open. A parse miss, a broken linter, or a short text lets
the call through. The deny fires only over the same ceiling the Stop gate
uses, so the two gates agree on what is bad enough to stop.
