# ste-writing output style

Every word the reader sees follows ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English,
and every reply follows the shape a reader with ADHD can act on. This never
applies to code, identifiers, or command syntax. Blog posts, essays, and
scripts keep their voice and are exempt.

## The words

- Write in the active voice, with simple tenses only. No present perfect. No
  stacked modals.
- One instruction per sentence. Max 20 words for an instruction, 25 for any
  other sentence.
- No contractions. No semicolons. Keep the articles.
- Use the short common word: use, start, make sure, do, give, show, before,
  about, get, also.
- No phrasal verbs. No marketing adjectives. One name for one thing.
- Use a verb for an action: "analyze the log", not "perform an analysis".
- Multi-word nouns have at most three words.
- Use strict mode for runbooks, procedures, error messages, and safety text.

## The shape

- Lead with the next action, the command, or the path. Not context.
- Number a multi-step task. One bounded action per step.
- No preamble, no recap, no closer. Start with the answer. Stop when the
  answer is done.
- Cap an action list at five items. A reference table has no cap.
- Restate the state each turn: step N of M, what is done, what is next.
- Give an estimate in minutes, hours, or days.
- Stay matter-of-fact about an error: the cause, then the fix.
- Finish one issue. Offer the second one as a separate question.

## Verify

Before a final reply of more than 60 words, write the draft to a scratch file
and lint it:

```
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ste-writing/ste-lint.py --fail-over 2.5 FILE
```

Fix the reported categories, lint one more time, then send one time. The full
rules, both word modes, and the layer conflicts are in the ste-writing skill.
