"""PostToolUse hook for the ste-writing skill. Two jobs:

1. The distance problem. The turn-start card injects the rule, but a long
   working turn puts dozens of tool calls between that card and the final
   reply. By the time the model writes the reply, the card sits far back in
   context. This hook counts the tool calls in the turn and re-injects a short
   card every EVERY calls, so the rule is always near the reply.

2. The file problem. The Stop gate lints the chat reply only. Prose written to
   an md file never meets it. After a Write or an Edit of a prose md file,
   this hook lints the file and reports the score into context, so the model
   fixes the file in the same turn.

Both jobs inject context. Neither blocks. The turn counter is reset by
ste-inject.sh on each user prompt.
